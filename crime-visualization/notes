1) Initial graph upon loading should be how seattle is ranked on average compared to state average

2) Display bar graph in percentage with data labels - How much safer is Seattle compared to rest of Washington?
    - X Axis: years [2012, 2013 etc.]
    - Y Axis: percentages "10%"
    - Seattle count / (State count + Seattle count) = Percentage
    - Percentage is how likely incident will happen in Seattle compared to rest of WA

3) Mobile view not ideal with current row-chart display, possible column chart to allow extension of y-axis for proper mobile viewing?


4) Navigation links to navigate to separate components containing a apexchart for specific crime index
    - Why? Crime index contains 5 years of data and displaying all 5 years of data for each crime index in a single graph is too much and visibly not pleasing
    - Separation of crime index to display increase and decline of occurrences through the span of 5 years of data 
    - Approach.....Pass city and state data as props to child components

5) Rename National.vue to something else not that we're not comparing to national averages
    - Currently it's city of Seattle compared to its home state, Washington
    - Possible names: City.vue? CityRisk.vue?

6) Easy way to pass data is to use a custom service, DataStorage crime-index components can call to retrieve data instead of making more API calls like CityRisk.vue

7) % Crime Occurring for all crime indexes - city / (city + state) for each year
